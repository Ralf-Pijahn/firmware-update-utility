// SUMMARY:
// Desktop version of XMODEM based on the full .NET Framework.
//
// FEATURES:
// Sender and Receive cancel a file transfer upon receipt of a single <CAN> byte, for compatibility with terminals that only send 1 <CAN> 
// byte per cancellation, like TeraTerm.
//
// When Sender or Receiver wishes to cancel a file transfer, they send multiple <CAN> bytes, for compatibility with those terminals that 
// require consecutive <CAN> bytes in order to cancel.
//
// An XModem-CRC or XModem-1K Receiver automatically reverts to the older XModem-Checksum if the Sender does not support the newer formats, 
// as outlined in Chuck Forsberg's official documentation.
//
// An XModem-1K Receiver can accept data packets that are a mixture of 128-bytes and/or 1024-bytes long. Chuck Forsberg's official documentation
// allows XModem-1K Senders to transmit data packets of either length, so for maximum compatibility with various implementations, this 
// XModem-1K Receiver is flexible as well.
// 
// However, to accomodate XModem-1K Receiver implementations that are not capable of receiving packets with different lengths, this XModem-1K 
// Sender always sends 1024 data bytes per packet.
//
// Receiver accepts both <EOT> and <EOF> as file termination bytes. The official documentation specifies <EOT> to indicate end of file, 
// but some MS-DOS and Microsoft implementations of XModem send <EOF> instead. Both values are accepted for maximum compatibility.
//
// This Sender uses <EOT> to indicate end of file. However, a custom byte value can be specified via EndOfFileByteToSend.
//
// This Sender automatically updates its variant (XModem-1K, XModem-CRC or XModem-Checksum) according to the file initiation byte received. This
// allows it to upgrade to a newer variant or downgrade to an older one according to the variant requested by the Receiver.
//
// TrimPaddingBytesFromEnd() can be used to remove trailing padding bytes that are normally added to the end of the file to create a uniform packet
// length. Removing trailing padding bytes is recommended to ensure that the received file is identical byte-for-byte to its original version.

        // TERMINAL PROGRAM OBSERVATIONS:
        //
        // TeraTerm UTF-8 Pro:
        // XModem-1K ALWAYS sends 1024 data bytes/packet.
        // When Receiver cancels, only 1 <CAN> byte is sent. The <CAN> byte is sent as a standalone byte outside a packet. The Sender simply stops transmitting
        // at the nearest whole packet, and no acknowledgement is returned.
        // When Sender cancels, no control bytes are sent. Transmission simply stops at the nearest whole packet. Only the Receiver interpacket timeout will abort 
        // the transfer on the Receiver side.
        //
        // HyperTerminal 7.0:
        // XModem-1K USUALLY sends 1024 data bytes/packet. However, it can also switch to 128-byte packets if the portion to send is short.
        // When Receiver cancels, 5 <CAN> bytes are sent. The Sender simply stops transmitting at the nearest whole packet, and no acknowledgement is returned.
        // When Sender cancels, 5 <CAN> bytes are sent. The Receiver does not acknowledge. (An <ACK> is sent, but it's actually in response to the final
        // whole packet sent, not the cancellation notification.)
        //
        // This Implementation:
        // For both Sender and Receiver, requesting a cancellation is done by sending <CAN> 5 times. If the Sender or Receiver receives at least 1 <CAN> byte, 
        // transfer will abort. If the Sender receives the cancellation, it will stop at the nearest whole packet. No acknowledgement is sent under any 
        // circumstances by any party, in response to a cancellation.  When transmitting over a a long distance noisy channel, such as a telephone line, 
        // aborting on a single <CAN> byte can be problemmatic due to other standalone control bytes possibly being corrupted into <CAN> and triggering an 
        // unintended abort. However, this implementation is intended to be operated by devices that are directly connected via a serial cable, and so the risk
        // of byte corruption is much less. Aborting on a single <CAN> allows this implementation to respond to terminal software that only sends 1 <CAN> 
        // like TeraTerm. However, if this is problematic, NumCancellationBytesRequired can be used to set the minimum number of cancellation bytes that
        // will result in cancellation.
        //
        // On G120 largest byte array size permissible = 786364 bytes
